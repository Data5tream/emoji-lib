# Emojicon

This library allows apps to use emojis on devices which don't have native emoji support.

This fork uses the new style created by  [@rocboronat](https://github.com/rocboronat/emojicon) and the popup keyboard created by [@ankushsachdeva](https://github.com/ankushsachdeva/emojicon).

## Building in Android Studio

Via Gradle:

```
compile 'com.github.data5tream:emojicon:1.3'
```
